# guru99_banking_Selenium
In this project I'm taking part in a Guru99's Live Selenium project: https://www.guru99.com/live-selenium-project.html.

The aim of the project is to test myself in an online Corporate Test Environment. Automating Selenium test cases for a demo banking website. Creating & executing automation scripts and having an opportunity to compare them with sample scripts created by experts in real-time.
